This project involves using the sales data of a pizza outlet for the year 2022 in order to gain information about the following key performance indicators:   
                       <li> Total revenue generated in the year in dollars
                       <li> Total number of pizzas sold in the year
                       <li> Total number of orders received in the year
                       <li> Average cost of an order in dollars
                       <li> Average pizzas sold per order
<br/><br/> The following steps were followed while developing this project:

<I><B>Data preparation phase</B></I>
<br/>In order to prepare the dataset for use in the project, data exploration was done to find fields of interest and data cleaning was done to ensure that invalid/missing data was corrected so to eradicate the possibility of incorrect insights in the final report. 

<I><B>Working with SQL</B></I>
<br/>The clean data obtained from the data preparation phase was loaded into MS SQL Sever.SQL queries were created and executed for the creation of KPIs and various fields of interest to find patterns and trends in the data.

<I><B>Working with Power BI</B></I>
<br/>In order to represent the data visually , the cleansed data was loaded into Power BI and underwent furthur exploration. DAX measures were used to create new attributes from the existing attributes and then a dashboard was created to generate colourfula appealing visuals for KPIs and other fields of interest such as :         
                      <li> Orders received per day and per month
                      <li> Pizza sales by category and size
                      <li> Sales trends observed from the data
                      <li> Best and worst selling pizzas
                     
In order to make the dashboard interactive and easy to use, filters were added that allow the dashboard to be changed as per various parameters such as pizza category, the range of day in which the pizzas were sold or to check for sales' records for a specific day.

<I><B>Comparison phase</B></I>
<br/>This was the final step of the project where the created dashboard was compared with the outputs received from the SQL queries in order to ensure that the dashboard created provided correct insights .
